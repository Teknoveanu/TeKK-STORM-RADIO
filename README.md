About TeKSTORM RADIO

TeKSTORM RADIO emerged from the genuine free party scene - a space where authenticity thrives outside commercial constraints. This isn't about mainstream recognition or profit; it's about preserving and sharing the raw energy of free tekno culture that's increasingly hard to find.

We exist to connect people with the true underground spirit - the DIY ethics, the collective experiences, the temporary autonomous zones where people share a common vibe. Our sound system carries the essence of spontaneous gatherings in forgotten spaces, where the music, people, and moment create something genuine that can't be packaged or sold.

Through our programs like BRAIN DEAD, RIDE OR DIE, FREE TEKNO, SYNTHETEKK, INSIDEOUT, RAID MY PONY, SAY NOYES TO DRUGS, TEKK ATTACK, TEKK NATION, PSYCHYATRY and NO WAY OUT, we're filling a void in the scene, not to make it mainstream, but to keep its flame burning for those who seek it.
